## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Gesture Controlled Robot Car. The robot car is designed to be controlled using hand gestures captured by a webcam and transmitted wirelessly using an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The project combines software (Python) for gesture recognition and hardware (Arduino) for motor control to create a fun and interactive robot car.

## Features

- Control the robot car's movement using hand gestures: Left, Right, Forward, Backward, and Stop.
- Real-time gesture recognition using OpenCV in Python.
- Wireless communication between Python program and Arduino using HC-05 Bluetooth module.
